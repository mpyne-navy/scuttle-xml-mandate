title: Sounding the &lt;DANGER/&gt; signal
---
<p class=""><span class="">I write this article to argue that the Navy’s decision to standardize data storage and data transmission using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), while well-intentioned, is a replay of a legacy effort that was tried and abandoned commercially more than a decade ago. To comply with DoD cloud strategy and the Navy’s own announced preference for commercial best practice, the Navy should retract the mandate for XML and instead implement modern data and interface specification methods to build to an ecosystem of understandable data, usable for timely decision making throughout the Navy and DoD.</span></p>

<h1 id="h.est1er72csq6">Executive Summary</h1>
<p class=""><span class="">The Compile to Combat in 24 Hours (C2C24) effort should help Navy’s digital modernization, except for a fatal flaw: it mandates use of a legacy commercial data format (XML) for data storage and transfer, and marries that to an unpopular data compression scheme (EXI). It does this despite there being widely-used modern alternatives (including JSON and Apache Avro), which would be banned by this mandate.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">This choice has several serious issues that will make it unworkable for Navy usage:</span></p>

<ul class="">
  <li><span>XML is complicated for computers to read and understand. Its complexity has caused </span><b>serious security issues</b><span> over the years which has made XML a </span><b>“Top 10” Web security threat</b><span class="">.</span></li>
  <li><span>The </span><span>commercial cloud </span><b>scalable databases</b><span> and ‘Big data’ </span><b>analytics services</b><span> we would migrate to in C2C24 do not natively support XML, instead </span><span>preferring JSON</span><span>. This will </span><b>force Navy to build custom</b><span> applications and systems just to handle XML when we could otherwise have used cloud services. This also </span><b>forces Navy to secure and accredit</b><span> these systems for use, </span><span>at substantial cost</span><span class="">.</span></li>
  <li><span>Mandating sole use of XML will cause </span><b>significant</b><span> </span><b>recruiting and retention issues</b><span> in a critical personnel specialty, that will be sorely required to meet </span><em>Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority 2.0</em><span> requirements for data-driven decision making and use of AI &amp; machine learning. We compete with a </span><b>voracious private sector</b><span class=""> for IT talent and should not self-inflict problems.</span></li>
  <li><span>Standardizing on XML provides </span><b>no data standardization benefit</b><span> that is not also provided by commercially-relevant alternatives like JSON. If it did, there would be more commercial usage, but </span><b>only 4.4% of web page requests</b><span> in Google’s metrics </span><b>use XML</b><span class=""> for data transfer.</span></li>
  <li><span>XML produces data </span><b>too large for IT networks</b><span> to send </span><span>afloat. The EXI compression solution offered as a fix has no commercial adoption, and doesn’t address the bulk of non-XML data that would be transferred for Web applications. </span><b>Modern Web compression solves this problem</b><span> for all uncompressed data, is </span><b>already available afloat</b><span class=""> today, and works best on non-XML data.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="">Many arguments have been offered in support of XML, but these arguments, by their own logic of seeking commercially-popular and standardized solutions, are even more supportive of XML alternatives. <em>If we are truly going to emulate the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft and use commercial best practice, then we can’t standardize on XML alone</em>.</p>

<h1 id="h.2c2z4kmgqzri">Introduction</h1>
<p class=""><span class="">The Navy is faced with perhaps the most complex IT environment of any of the U.S. armed forces, operating networks that must routinely be disconnected from the DoD Information Network (DoDIN), and from the public Internet, while still being able to connect to nearby joint forces. This problem would be bad enough, but significant policy barriers, lengthy acquisition processes, and routine underinvestment in modern IT has created an environment in which the Navy struggles to enjoy the benefit of the “cloud” age of computing.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Recently the Navy announced an effort, </span><em>Compile to Combat in 24 Hours</em><span> (C2C24)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="">, that offers to radically improve and streamline the process for delivering IT-based capability, even including deployed units afloat. This effort would align IT infrastructure both ashore and afloat behind commercial cloud technologies, including radical automation as done by the best Silicon Valley companies. In addition, data standardization is called for since even the most powerful algorithms produce garbage if fed garbage.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">This is all good! Many of us have waited some time for the Navy to show signs of life in its IT enterprise, and for those of us C2C24 was an unexpected boon out of nowhere… if it delivers on its promise.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Unfortunately, the C2C24 announcement specified that not only should the Navy take efforts to standardize data, but that it must do so using a legacy XML format. Ironically, this decision is the one part of C2C24 that is directly contradictory to the rest of the announcement, and directly contradictory to the DoD’s recently published DoD Cloud Strategy, as it represents a clean break from industry best practice and modern cloud computing, in its use of XML and its reliance on an XML compression scheme that has no commercial adoption. Although an effort to standardize on XML would have made sense back in 2003, the commercial IT ecosystem has changed significantly in the 16 years since then.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>To realize the benefits C2C24 aims for it won’t be good enough to adopt modern cloud data </span><em>processing</em><span> technologies, we must also adopt modern cloud data </span><em>structuring</em><span> techniques, for precisely the same reason the C2C24 announcement made “Data Standardization” a key pillar of the C2C24 effort. The infinitely scalable cloud-powered technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence and “Big Data” processing that the Navy is attempting to adopt via C2C24 was simply not designed to operate on XML data and can’t be forced to do so just because we standardize it, any more than a U.S. state could make π to be exactly 3.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class=""> In fact the “pay as you go” model of cloud computing has instead led to significant innovation on how to structure and store data to cut cloud costs, frequently by more than 50%, but these innovations are not available to data stored only as XML.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.5jdfltgcg9an">Brief Interlude on XML</h2>

<p class=""><span class="">This paper is arguing in opposition to a mandate for XML usage imposed on Navy developers. My goal was to keep it short, which means focusing on the argument. Adding the amount of detail needed to be persuasive on a complex technical topic bloats the word count significantly, which makes it that much more important to be concise elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">This is all to say that this paper may read like an attack on XML generally, but that’s not really my intent. XML itself has use cases for which it is a fine alternative, and often even the best alternative (yes, even now in 2019). In fact my initial drafts on this paper were even written in a language (Asciidoc) that helps generates XML for subsequent editing, because computer-readable “tagging” of human-authored documents continues to be a strong suit for XML. I have personal and open-source projects that use XML and will continue to do so. I am not arguing that XML should be sought and eradicated on sight.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">In fact, XML is directly responsible for a great deal of the migration of modern computing from a glut of custom protocols where computers and networks couldn’t talk to each other, into a “Internet” of networks that form the Web ecosystem that has generated incredible value for the world.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">As we’ll see, the aspirations of XML’s developers were even broader, and they didn’t meet them all. But any computer scientist would (and should) be proud to have been involved in developing and popularizing XML—it has truly changed the world, for the better. All the same, it is but a step of the ladder along the way to the modern cloud-native ecosystem, and it is important that the Navy doesn’t tie itself to this step and prevent progress from continuing to climb that ladder where appropriate for our mission sets.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">I described in the Executive Summary the five major reasons I see of course in the Navy context:</span></p>

<ol class=" lst-kix_cuccmufq2tm3-0 start" start="1">
  <li><span>XML is a “Top 10 Web Security Threat” due to its inherent complexity</span></li>
  <li><span class="">The commercial cloud doesn’t support sole use of XML; we have to use other formats too</span></li>
  <li><span class="">Mandating XML will harm IT recruiting and retention</span></li>
  <li><span>XML adoption alone doesn’t really solve the data standardization issues we have</span></li>
  <li><span>XML is too bloated for Navy use; the proposed “EXI” solution would be effectively proprietary to DoD as it has not gained even minimal usage in the commercial cloud despite a decade-plus of time to standardize and a decade-plus of effort from research at Naval Postgraduate School.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=""><span>The Navy will benefit by cleaning up our data story even if some systems use XML. But a mandate for </span><em>sole use of XML</em><span class=""> is the wrong way to go about cleaning up our data and will greatly complicate the development and operation of services where XML doesn’t cleanly fit.</span></p>
<h1 id="h.725jw9ieg8rr">The Problems with the XML Mandate</h1>
<h2 id="h.5cvn6ljnzqky">Cybersecurity</h2>

<p class=""><span>XML is a highly complicated standard for data, intended to permit computers to “read into” information written by humans by defining a ‘markup’ that computers could easily understand.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span> XML’s developers expanded its scope from there to try and build an entire ecosystem of XML data and XML-related standards, so XML includes many features useful for potential attackers. These include features that permit XML documents to reach out to other documents on the Web, automatically send data to Web sites, to build custom XML ‘nouns’ that XML processors must support, and add comments and special processing instructions anywhere in the document. These have all been used in security attacks on users of XML, and such attacks continue to the present day, including an attack on Internet Explorer that was publicized during the development of this paper.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="h.zbildi9he0kg">XML: A History of Security Flaws</h3>

<p class=""><span>The decisions that led XML’s developers to include the features that gave it such a large ‘attack surface’ were perhaps reasonable in the relatively benign environment of the mid-1990s when XML standardization began in earnest. But these features have led to significant and widespread security issues over time, both in software that </span><em>uses XML at all</em><span class="">, and even in multiple XML-based standards meant to improve security of information systems.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">These flaws have stemmed from the complexity of understanding XML itself. To try to employ an analogy, if a program reading a simpler data format is like reading a printed table of figures, then a program reading XML is like trying to ‘mind meld’ with the other party. This can be a powerful way to transfer complex information, but also puts the recipient at risk if the other party has sinister intent.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>One example of the security issues with XML’s complexity are the multitude of serious security issues that have been found in the various XML processing libraries that exist to allow software developers to use XML. These libraries are the right tool for the job and give software developers the best shot at properly using XML. All the same, these libraries have been the source of </span><span>dozens</span><span class=""> of security flaws over the years.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>For instance, Microsoft users have been affected by 4 distinct vulnerabilities allowing malicious XML (typically from websites) to takeover a user’s machine. The XML library popular in the Linux and Apple ecosystem, “libxml”, has suffered as well, with 69 separate vulnerabilities since 2003 rated MEDIUM or HIGH severity.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class=""> These flaws have resulted in hacks of Google infrastructure and Apple iOS, and the issue is growing worse over time, as indicated in the diagram of reported vulnerabilities in XML libraries shown in Figure 1 below.</span></p>

<p class=""><span>Some of these vulnerabilities are the kind of coding error that any data format processing library might be susceptible to, but many of these are </span><span>inherent to XML specifically</span><span>. High severity examples include:</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p class="">The examples of vulnerabilities on the previous page are inherent to features of the XML data format that are not necessarily present in alternatives. Not all of these are necessarily </span><em>unique</em><span class=""> to XML—data formats that include similar features are typically discovered to also have similar vulnerabilities. But the evolution of computing has been to use simpler (i.e. more secure) data formats where possible, precisely because the example of XML and other structure-rich data formats has been to show that they are quite risky.</p>

<h3 id="h.lbyp0td8iuxt">SAML: Undermined by XML</h3>
<p class="">In addition to generic XML support libraries, <span>XML-based security standards have been routinely subverted as well, due directly to their XML-based nature. The popular XML-based Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard is so difficult to securely implement, that a 2012 study of popular SAML libraries found only 2 out of 14 libraries were able to properly implement the XML digital signature handling required to safely trust SAML assertions.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span> As the study notes, “This result is alarming given the importance of SAML in practice, especially since [single sign-on] frameworks may become a single point of attack. It clearly indicates that the security implications behind SAML and </span><em>XML Signature</em><span class=""> are not understood yet.” (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p class="">Solving these bugs isn’t simple—this study broke one of the SAML libraries <em>twice</em><span class="">, with the study’s authors finding another flaw after the vendor’s security team had addressed the first flaw. It is notable here that the affected vendor, SalesForce, has one of the best security teams in the business!</span></p>
<p class="">As an example of what we’d be asking our XML developers to grapple with, consider Pawel Krawczyk’s SAML security guide. Krawczyk published this guide in 2014 to address the flaws identified in the 2012 study, and he lays out multiple steps required to securely implement and use SAML. An important topic from this guide includes ensuring that “XML Path” <a id="id.wr8h13m31saq"></a><span>expressions are secured. A very simple XML path expression like  </span><span class="c32 c5">/</span><span class="c22 c29">soape:Envelope</span><span class="c32 c5">/</span><span class="c22 c29">soape:Body</span><span> would need to be converted to instead read as </span><span class="c32 c5">/*[local­name()=</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c22 c29">Envelope</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c32 c5"> and namespace­uri()=</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c22 c29">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c32 c5">][1]/*[local­name()=</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c22 c29">Body</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c32 c5"> and namespace­uri()=</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c22 c29">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/</span><span class="c22">"</span><span class="c32 c5">][1</span><span class="c5 c32">]</span><span>, otherwise the system may </span><b>still</b><span> be insecure</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p class="">This is to ensure that the “XML Namespace” (<span class="c22 c29">soape</span><span class=""> in this example) is not modified by an attacker to cause the XML Path expression to change result and that additional XML tags can’t be supplied by an attacker to fool a SAML implementation into trusting the wrong part of the XML document. Hope you caught all that!</span></p>
<p class="">Other data formats support Path expressions but not Namespaces, which eliminates this potential security risk, and to further improve security, modern equivalents to SAML don’t use Path expressions at all.</p>
<p class="">You might be forgiven for thinking that this is just IT developer jargon and “not a big problem for the professionals”. And while it’s true that IT developers would know what’s going on here if told, it is decidedly <em>not true</em><span> that developers would get this right on their own based on training and experience, especially as the XML Path expressions get more complicated. And this is just one corner of XML! It is for this reason that Okta, a leading identity and access management cloud service provider, recommends “If you’re a developer building systems to integrate with SAML vendors or single sign-on providers, try to </span><b>NOT integrate using SAML if possible</b><span>. Instead: use a more modern identity standard such as OpenID Connect.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class=""> (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p class="">It is also important to emphasize that the security problems noted here with SAML are directly linked to its usage of XML and XML-based standards such as XPath, XML Signatures, and XML Encryption. SAML issues are not peculiar to poor choices made by the SAML designers that could have been avoided by smarter designers. SAML’s issues root from its choice to build atop the wider XML ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="h.bjvff8i7ffp2">SAML Part II: XML Strikes Again</h3>
<p class=""><span>In case you’re wondering if this was a one-off issue that once resolved, would make SAML safe, the answer is “No!”. In 2018, four years after Krawczyk published his detailed guidance on how to securely implement SAML, Duo Labs discovered a new technique to attack SAML based on core XML functionality, disclosing that 6 popular SAML implementations (including Duo’s own implementation!) were vulnerable.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class=""> 3 of these 6 had also been impacted by the XML digital signature issues described in the previous SAML attacks. This happened despite having plenty of time to pre-emptively audit and implement appropriate mitigations as recommended in Krawczyk’s guidance.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">All of this is particularly alarming for SAML in particular, since SAML is typically used as a solution to sign in to multiple systems. This makes the impact of SAML flaws particularly severe, since if you can convince a SAML implementation that you have logged in (as both studies succeeded in doing) then you will be issued tokens that you can use to access sensitive data from multiple separate systems. Why spend a lot of money doing the IT equivalent of building capabilities to forge passports with all their anti-counterfeiting techniques, when you can convince the State Dept. to just issue you a valid passport with whatever information you wish?</span></p>

<h3 id="h.g7sllurbldgl">Even the “Pros” Can’t Safely Use XML</h3>
<p class=""><span>Even if you don’t use SAML, just using XML is enough to put your systems at risk unless you can consistently show more implementation discipline than the likes of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Oracle and IBM. A Navy tester recently found a vulnerability in a Navy personnel system (named CVE-2018-3192) based on misuse of a well-vetted “XML stylesheet transformation” library by the software vendor.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span> Even newly developed software from competent organizations that have used XML for years are frequently impacted by XML-specific vulnerabilities, including IBM’s Mobility as a Service 360 Platform, vulnerable to an “XML eXternal Entity (XEE)” flaw.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span> The immediate key takeaway for the security researcher who found the flaw in IBM’s platform was “XML is a dangerous data format that’s </span><b>easy to handle incorrectly</b><span>. If you see it, get excited.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class=""> (emphasis added).</span></p>
<p class=""><span>XML security is so fraught with danger that XML usage was added as an OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security risk in 2017, even though XML usage for Web applications was </span><em>already lower</em><span> than alternatives in 2017.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span> The OWASP organization recommends “Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON”. The complexity is the key here—these XML security standards and XML libraries were designed, built and tested by smart and competent developers, but the problem (making XML secure) is simply intractable. The Navy has smart and competent IT staff as well, but we are </span><em>not</em><span class=""> more competent than the commercial space here, so we should expect to continue to suffer the same issues if we standardize on XML.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.617xpe6pnxb4">Commercial Cloud Support</h2>
<p class=""><span>Now let’s assume that the cybersecurity issues inherent to XML and the XML ecosystem are resolvable. Even if that were the case, we still couldn’t standardize on XML, because the commercial cloud services that we are attempting to migrate to for “Big Data” are </span><b>all</b><span class=""> incompatible with the sole use of XML as a data format. This impacts services handling functions such as advanced analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data storage and transfer, using “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices and scalable data transaction processing.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Instead, various other formats are used for purposes spanning data interchange (using JSON, CSV, Thrift or Avro) up to optimized data analytics (using JSON, CSV, Parquet or ORC). And in the “pay to the penny for what you use” cloud model, making the right choice here has significant cost and performance implications. It’s not that the cloud can’t store XML data—the issue is that the cloud won’t </span><b>do</b><span class=""> anything with it. They’ll hold onto it and give it back to you if you ask for it, but they won’t index it to speed up data queries, they won’t query it, they won’t feed it into their data analytic services, they won’t train machine learning models using it, and the list keeps going.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Here’s a table of some of the cloud services that only support data formats popular in industry (not XML):</span></p>

<p class=" c50"><span class="c18 c15">Table 1</span><span class="c19 c15">: Support for data formats amongst various cloud service providers</span></p>

<p class=" c48"><span class="">This is not to say that commercial cloud providers don’t support XML at all. They sometimes provide support for subsets of XML (such as with AWS Glue and Azure Search), and every cloud provider offers standard database offerings that descend from databases with support for storing and processing XML data, such as AWS Relational Database Service and Azure SQL Database.</span></p>

<p class=""><span>However, these standard databases also support JSON, and none are designed to store </span><span>only</span><span> XML (or JSON) data, as these violate the relational data model standard databases are most suited for. As Microsoft notes for its own relational database, “If you have pure JSON workloads where you want to use a query language that’s customized for the processing of JSON documents, consider Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class=""> Note that Cosmos DB does not support XML, it only supports JSON.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Why do cloud providers hew so closely to JSON when XML is available? Well, because that’s where the developer mindshare has gone, as shown in </span><span>Figure 2</span><span class=""> on the following page, showing trends of developer questions on the popular Stack Overflow question and answer site for JSON, CSV, XML, and XML-based webpages:</span></p>
<p class="figure">
<img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 538.50px; height: 369.87px;" title=""/>
</p>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="c18 c15">Figure 2</span><span class="c15">: Relative proportion of StackOverflow (a popular developer reference site) questions tagged by topic over time</span><sup class="c15"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p class=""><span>The conclusion here is stark: If we intend to use the commercial cloud, and standardize on only a single data format, that format </span><b>cannot be XML</b><span>. XML is not supported by the breadth of cloud services we are modernizing to pursue. </span><b>We should not standardize on <em>any</em> single data format</b><span> as there are significant cost and performance implications to the choice of data format across different uses cases, potentially permitting cost reductions in excess of 99%!</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class=""> OpenBridge has an example where converting data to Parquet format saved 99.7% of cloud usage and storage costs. But if we did want to pick a single format despite that, the right format would not be XML, but JSON based on its wide support amongst the cloud services appropriate to the Navy’s needs and aligned with the DoD Cloud Strategy.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.wouh3j55p7up">IT Talent Management</h2>
<p class=""><span>Even if XML were as secure as simpler data formats, and even if cloud providers offered solid support for XML data, there would still be a large issue, as hokey as it sounds: </span><em>No one wants to use XML</em><span>. InfoWorld put it bluntly two years ago, “Choosing XML over JSON when building a new web service is a red flag likely to turn away talent, because it indicates a </span><b>lack of interest in staying relevant</b><span>.” (emphasis mine).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p class=""><span class="">This is somewhat unfair as solid technologies have often fallen prey to being on the wrong side of the hype cycle despite offering an equivalent or even superior technological approach. But the DoD has already famously been on the wrong end of this one before, when the DoD tried and failed to standardize its software development on the Ada programming language, which was outcompeted in programmer’s minds by languages like C and C++ despite offering real benefits in safely writing software.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Ada was at least arguably better than C and C++. XML is worse than JSON, Parquet, Avro and others, and the private sector has built up around these latter formats substantially faster than the defense-related talent pool for software developers has for XML. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Navy will the XML ecosystem to its prior height at this point, but there is every reason to believe Navy will push developers away if we try. It would be ironic indeed for the Navy to finally take a step towards resolving long-running IT talent recruiting and retention issues by launching a vision of a modern age of computing in the Navy, only to then take three steps backwards by forcing an unpopular data format on its IT talent.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I should be clear here that XML </span><b>lost out fair and square</b><span class=""> in developer mindshare in the commercial space. It’s not an ugly duckling that was never given a fair shake, on the contrary it was popular for years (because it was the only game in town) until it was mostly supplanted by data formats whose strengths were fit for the mission while addressing the downsides XML users couldn’t avoid. The industry moved away for a reason, and trying to force our IT talent back to XML will force them to choose between staying relevant or staying Navy. We should also bear in mind that this would be a Navy-specific problem: the U.S. Air Force has a project (<a href="https://kesselrun.af.mil/">Kessel Run</a>) that is rapidly growing in developer mindshare because they actively advertise—and execute on—the ability to do modern software development.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.xz6dvpts6jug">XML Doesn’t Solve Data Standards</h2>
<p class=""><span>This would all be a bit depressing if XML were really the only solution to our data standards needs and we couldn’t adopt it. But there’s good news: XML isn’t the only solution to our data standards needs. In fact, </span><em>XML adoption doesn’t solve data standardization at all</em><span>. We </span><b>do</b><span class=""> need to solve data standardization, just as the commercial space has needed to solve data standards, but when we do solve it, the lessons will apply even with other data formats.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">To give an example, it would be possible to write XML documents that put the bare requirement of XML tags around non-XML data (like JSON). These would be “fully valid” XML documents that “fully conform to the schema”, but by the logic of the C2C24 announcement they’d be useless for data standardization because the meat of the data wouldn’t be XML at all. The point here is that it’s not enough simply to put your data into XML format, there’s real work that must go on even before you write a single byte of data, XML or otherwise.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">So what do we really need to do for data standardization? It comes down to mostly a few things:</span></p>
<ol class=" lst-kix_ykwyem14egzq-0 start" start="1">
  <li><span class="c53">Naming standards</span><span>: If I call a data element “</span><span class="c22">NAME</span><span>”, that still leaves a lot of questions. Is that a person’s name? Something else like a space or void in a ship? Is that from a field I control or am I tracking this data element to feed into a later process I </span><em>don’t</em><span class=""> control? In the XML model you’d solve this with heavy use of XML “namespaces”, but in today’s ecosystem you’d typically ensure that reasonably detailed names are used within a single “application programming interface” (API). Since a single API has only a single owner, it is possible to avoid conflicts and to document the details that don’t fit into a data element’s name. That is, instead of controlling a huge data bundle to make sure you can always pour in more data without conflicts, and then moving that huge vat of data around, you control the interface between sender and receiver such that the interface properly documents the subset of data moving around, and both sender and receiver can check that the interface is obeyed. XML can be used for data flowing across an interface! But so can other formats, and in 2019 most APIs use JSON, or at least support JSON—APIs can support multiple data formats and many APIs do just that.</span></li>
  <li><span class="c53">Format of data element</span><span>: This goes into the types of data that are contained in a data element. Back to the “</span><span class="c22">NAME</span><span class="">” example: Are non-Latin letters like 宮本 茂 permitted? For English names, is it last name then comma then first, or first then space then last? How are missing middle initials handled? However this is answered, it’s possible to document that answer for whatever data format we’re using, and documenting this for each data element is the bulk of the work of data standardization. XML offers no help here as this is a question for the business process.</span></li>
  <li><span class="c53">Structure of the data</span><span>: Finally, the way in which data elements are arranged is important. For instance if a Sailor has 8 different NECs, are they laid out in fields like “</span><span class="c22">NEC_01</span><span>”, “</span><span class="c22">NEC_02</span><span>”, and so on? Or are they laid out in a single field “</span><span class="c22">NECs</span><span class="">” as a list of NECs? Are these NECs just thrown in the Sailor’s digital record with all the other data elements, or are they grouped together with other training-related elements in a way that could be copied wholesale into other records? Again, this is not a question that XML uniquely solves.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class=""><span class="">Resolving these 3 questions across the multitude of database tables, structured (and semi-structured) documents and so on that comprise Navy and DoD workloads is the real line of effort to address. Once addressed it will be possible to port those results into appropriate data formats, so long as the authoritative schema is in terms of the simplest data format to be used (since it’s easier to port definitions from a simple data format to a more complicated one, but can be quite difficult to go in the reverse direction).</span></p>

<h3 id="h.3gswrohe48jz">Federal Guidance and Other Stakeholders</h3>
<p class=""><span>The Federal Government has an effort going focused on data standardization, the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM). While NIEM started off supporting XML data, NIEM today supports JSON as well.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class=""> Though even if they didn’t, the hard work would still be developing the data standard itself, not in describing the resultant data model using XML or JSON, Parquet, etc. So even in that view of the world, one could develop a NIEM-compatible JSON data model, easily construct an equivalent XML model if needed, and then use JSON from there to operate with scalable commercial cloud platforms using modern best practice.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Outside of NIEM, other Federal partners (such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and General Services Administration) have heavily adopted JSON, at least for data interchange.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span> Also the Federal CIO requires every Federal agency to implement statutory ‘open data’ requirements by publishing a list of the agency’s data resources in JSON format (see </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1559499944398000">https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/</a></span><span>). Even if the Navy wanted to go it alone, we’d still have to work with interagency, Joint and Allied partners that may require use of non-XML data formats.</span></p>

<p class=""><span>Finally, I will discuss the most unusual aspect of the C2C24 data standardization push: the mandatory adoption not only of XML, but of an XML-specific compression format, Efficient eXtensible Interchange (EXI), that has picked up no support with the commercial cloud providers we are migrating to despite being fully standardized since 2011.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span> In fact, EXI was standardized in a four-year process based on an existing product, AgileDelta’s “Efficient XML”.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span> So it has been </span><b>12 years</b><span class=""> that EXI has had a chance to strike a chord with cloud providers and the wider private sector, and in that time the industry moved elsewhere, as can be seen in Figure 3 below:</span></p>
<p class="figure">
<img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 385.33px" title="XML, JSON, EXI Google search trends"/>
</p>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="c18 c15">Figure 3</span><span class="c15">: Google search trends for XML, JSON, and EXI formats from 1 Jan 2004 to 21 Apr 2019</span><sup class="c15"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p class=""><span class="">For example, at the time I write this document, the Wikipedia entry for EXI is unable to note any significant commercial usage of EXI, and in fact references DoD specifically as a potential application of EXI, citing a student thesis from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). Frankly, DoD should not be a significant player in the selection and use of commercial standards, given the vibrancy and strength of the U.S. and international tech sector. If DoD adoption would be significant for a commercial standard, then something has gone gravely wrong.</span></p>

<a id="id.5tyrz0hyygv5"></a>

<p class=""><span>So if not EXI, how has the commercial sector solved its issues with XML bloat? As shown on Figure 4, the answer has been to move away from XML. This chart shows the size of various types of Web content for the “median website” based on Google metrics.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span> Even when including XML-based “SVG” images as XML, </span><em>the median website uses exactly 0 bytes of XML</em><span> data today (see </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="#h.4whldb3rgum1">Appendix A</a></span><span> for the analysis).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class=""> </span></p>

<p class=""><span>What this means is that data compression which works only on XML data is </span><b>useless</b><span>: Figure 4 below would also represent the data usage for the median web site </span><em>including EXI compression</em><span>. So while XML compression is notionally helpful, compression that works on many file types is </span><b>much</b><span class=""> more useful, and the same will be true of our Web-based systems, even if we were to standardize on XML.</span></p>

<p class="figure">
<img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 548.71px; height: 361.50px" title="Points scored"/>
</p>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="c18 c15">Figure 4</span><span class="c15">: Amount of data used by median website for various types of data</span></p>

<p class=""><span class="">Naturally pursuing improved general data compression is the direction that the commercial space has evolved, with companies like Google and Facebook developing improved compression schemes and working to get them implemented in popular Web servers and in popular Web browsers. Support in both is necessary, as both sides must support a given standard for the compression to be useful.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The best example of this is Google’s “brotli” compression format, which can reduce the size of the “CSS”, “Scripts” and “Fonts” components of Figure 4 above by anywhere from 10-30% more than the normal data compression method supported in all Web browsers, which is already about as much as EXI manages to find. Notably, Brotli is already supported on Navy browsers.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span> While the format is much newer than EXI, it has already achieved support in ~90% of Web browsers around the world.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class=""> Like EXI, Brotli has the benefit of being an international standard, specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 7932. Unlike EXI, Brotli works on all uncompressed data types, not only on XML. Even Brotli is not necessarily a giant improvement over existing data compression, but since it works on most data types and is already available it’s the best direction to proceed down where bandwidth is precious. See Figure 5 below to illustrate how data compression might impact the total size of a Web page:</span></p>

<p class="figure">
<img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 385.33px" title="Data Compression possibilities for median Web site"/>
</p>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="c18 c15">Figure 5</span><span class="c15">: Impact of data compression techniques on total Web site download sizes (gzip is the base compression scheme)</span></p>

<p class=""><span>There are other compression formats out there to choose from, especially for domains where “general purpose” compression will not suffice, like multimedia or “Big Data” analytics.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class=""> The key point here is that the Navy must determine which types of data is using up its bandwidth before it can determine which data compression scheme to apply. Once data compression is decided upon, the Navy should start with data formats that are widely supported by the vendors we rely upon, and only move on to more bespoke formats if the performance requirement absolutely justifies it.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>This concern is especially true of EXI, which is </span><b>not supported by default in any operating system</b><span>, Web server or Web browser which the Navy has in use, and which requires great care to configure in a way that beats general purpose compression tools. NPS research on EXI from 2015 showed that “... this experiment’s results indicate, in many cases these [EXI] defaults do not produce the smallest possible file size, and may not produce files smaller than conventional compression.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Unlike other data compression tools, we have no best practices to borrow from industry and a great deal more configuration options we’d have to get right to maximize the positive impact of EXI, and that only helps for XML data, which even Navy doesn’t have in large amount. We’d be on our own with EXI, maintaining it afloat, ashore, in our Web servers, in our networks, and in the commercial cloud.</span></p>

<h3 id="h.wg7vyadpm8il">Cybersecurity risks from data compression</h3>

<p class="">
  <span class="">Beyond the lack of industry support for EXI, EXI itself may not always be the most secure format to use for data transfer due to its built-in data compression. In the past few years several attacks have been developed against the security protocols used to provide data protection on the web, all of which rely on using data compression as a way to help guess the very secrets the security protocols were meant to guard.</span>
</p>

<p class=""><span>These attacks require multiple conditions to be met, they don’t automatically subvert the entire security approach. But these conditions have become much easier for attackers over the years, culminating in the “HEIST” attack, which can be launched using only malicious scripting on a website.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span> What’s more, these types of scripts are commonly distributed to unwitting users on perfectly legitimate sites using advertising distribution networks (for example the HEIST researchers’ presentation on the attack used a live demo by advertising on the New York Times website). While such malware is quickly eradicated once identified, the damage is usually already done. The best safeguard against these attacks is to </span><em>completely disable compression of sensitive data</em><span> that is generated on-the-fly (pre-compressing files before sending to browsers is OK).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p class=""><span>What this means for the typical Navy systems that use a standard Web application architecture to deliver Web-based content is that they cannot rely on the use of any compression for sensitive data.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class=""> Not EXI, not the “modern” methods like Brotli discussed above, or even the historical methods like gzip.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">EXI does have a mode that turns off its built-in compression, which would make it seem as if it would still be a reasonable “lighter XML”, the other objections aside. However disabling compression still leaves an important compression feature turned on (making the data susceptible to the HEIST attack). This extra compression (the “string table”) can also be turned off, but turning off the string table eliminates the majority of the improvement in data size that EXI would otherwise bring, leaving it nearly as “full fat” as raw XML would have been. This is clearly unacceptable, as there would have been no reason to develop EXI and force its use in the C2C24 announcement if raw XML were suitable here.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>JSON, on the other hand, has no compression logic or fancy string tables to apply. If you want it compressed, you have to do so separately. Moreover since JSON is a comparatively light format compared to XML, it </span><em>is</em><span class=""> a viable candidate for holding sensitive data that cannot afford to be compressed.</span></p>

<h1 id="h.cdec86gb0aay">Addressing pro-mandate Arguments</h1>

<p class=""><span class="">This paper is not the first time someone in the Navy has asked about the reasoning behind the XML mandate. Several arguments have been made in favor of mandating XML for all Navy IT, which I wish to address directly.</span></p>
<ul class="">
  <li><span>One argument has been that we cannot afford to focus on what is easiest for developers to use (i.e. JSON, which is directly aligned to most programming language data models). This </span><em>might </em><span>be reasonable if XML gave a large advantage elsewhere, like a mildly annoying application packaging method that provided a significant operational benefit. But there is no significant benefit to be gained here, given our stated desire to pursue modern commercial best practice and strong cybersecurity. In fact XML is a net negative for both cybersecurity and compatibility with </span><em>modern </em><span>best practice. The fact that it is significantly more cumbersome for developers (recall the </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="#id.wr8h13m31saq">XML Path example</a></span><span class=""> above) simply adds insult to injury.</span></li>
  <li><span class="">Another argument moves that XML is the only open commercial leading industry standard providing the following five benefits in a single data format, even with JSON in the mix. This is unpersuasive however, both because the five benefits are hardly unique to XML (as I’ll discuss), but also because this doesn’t address the more significant underlying assumption here that a single data format is required or even desirable. Somehow things on the open commercial Web work fine with both PNG images and JPEGs, with MPEG movies using H.264 and more advanced AVC-encoded videos, and so on. Meanwhile the widest application of XML by far in the DoD is the Microsoft Office suite of file formats, which are notoriously difficult for non-Microsoft Office programs to perfectly read despite being in a single data format, which proves that XML usage alone does not lead to or ensure interoperability.</span></li>
  <li><span class="">The five requirements listed are:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-0 start" start="1">
  <li><span class="">Interoperability at data element layer using an industry open standard with commercial software availability.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-1 start" start="1">
  <li class=" "><em>Response</em><span>: This is a fine requirement. It is met by XML, but also met by JSON, which is standardized as ECMA-404 and further refined as IETF RFC 8259, and which has <b>wide</b> and <b>vast</b> support in the commercial ecosystem.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span> This requirement is </span><b>not</b><span> met by EXI, which is standardized (by W3C) but has a quite limited commercial ecosystem, with very few vendors and little in the way of programming language support. The lack of a JavaScript implementation is especially glaring considering the intended Web-based use case, as this effectively ensures </span><em>Web browsers will not be able to directly use EXI</em><span class="">.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-0" start="2">
  <li><span class="">Availability of a W3C standardized compression ability for XML data to efficiently use limited bandwidth.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-1 start" start="1">
  <li class=" "><em>Response</em><span>: As stated, this is a circular requirement: “We have to use XML so that we can have standardized XML compression”. If we reword this a bit to meet the intended spirit, to ‘Availability of standardized </span><em>data</em><span> compression for data in transit, to efficiently use limited bandwidth’ then the aperture opens considerably. Although EXI outperforms typical Web-based compression methods, it’s not by a large margin. Brotli, described earlier in the paper, reaches compression parity with EXI and is standardized as RFC 7932.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class=""> Unlike EXI, Brotli has much broader support on both the Web server side and the Web browser side. Brotli is supported by much of the Navy today, already—for XML or for JSON, though JSON will generally be even smaller.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span>I recommend considering in this requirement how the data format will operate in today’s security landscape, where data compression of sensitive data in many contexts becomes an information leakage risk. Data compression may sometimes not be an option at all, making the </span><b>uncompressed</b><span class=""> size of the data being transferred that much more important.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-0" start="3">
  <li><span class="">SAML - standardized security protocol for XML for better protection at the data element layer- critical for our data in Cloud environment and to get to a future "zero trust" environment</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-1 start" start="1">
  <li class=" "><em>Response</em><span>: This confuses several aspects about SAML, data element protection, and future “zero trust” networks. There is no requirement to use XML data to use SAML, SAML is XML-based and intended to permit a user agent to obtain an access token to obtain services from a “service provider”, but once the access token is obtained the service provider can provide any appropriate service, including services involving non-XML data or even services that don’t involve data output at all. Even when using SAML, the access token doesn’t have to be an XML-encoded token (for example the Auth0 identity and access management cloud service supports SAML but uses JSON Web Tokens for the resulting access token).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup></li>
  <li class=" "><span>However, using SAML itself is a risky proposition compared to the more modern authentication and authorization systems widely available today, as was shown earlier in the </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="#h.5cvn6ljnzqky">Cybersecurity</a></span><span class=""> section of this paper. The XML-based nature of SAML has been used to subvert SAML’s security guarantees in multiple ways, including XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) and XML comment injection attacks.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span class="">The “data element” portion of this requirement appears meant to pertain to subsets of an overall XML document. SAML doesn’t provide this security, though other XML-based standards like XACML may do something similar. But given the pitfalls highly competent SAML library developers encountered trying to securely implement this very technique, it seems foolhardy to try to do better ourselves. Instead this type of security should be implemented in the database itself when required. If a traditional relational database is used, these controls are implemented using database-specific policies and commands, and apply to row- or column-level in a way that is not optimized for XML. If “NoSQL” document databases are used (which are more appropriate for the likes of XML and JSON), then the cloud-based NoSQL services we’d use only support JSON, which means we’d want to standardize on JSON to even start on meeting this requirement.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span>The “zero trust” mention is interesting, but XML is neither here nor there as far as zero trust network design goes. The book I have on zero trust networking hardly mentions either JSON or XML, though it does give an example of a network agent (one of the concepts ‘zero trust’ introduces) using a blob of JSON data to feed into the network agent.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span> It seems that JSON is at least as good as XML for zero trust networking.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-0" start="4">
  <li><span class="">Ability to leverage NSA approved cross domain guards which require XML for the tagging, to support future large data transfer needs.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-1 start" start="1">
  <li class=" "><em>Response</em><span>: Given the XML-based attacks discussed elsewhere, and the incredible reach of JSON in the commercial cloud ecosystem that we are intending to use, it seems the smarter thing is to do the minor bit of development work necessary to include JSON support to the existing XML support. Especially since the “NoSQL” database services most suited to the types of data described by XML and JSON that are fully accredited for DoD use in the “government cloud” environments only support JSON.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class=""> Given the massive amounts of data we’ll be handling, we will definitely need the help of the commercial cloud service providers, and both their NoSQL scalable databases and their data analytics services are biased towards JSON, CSV, Parquet, Apache Avro, etc. Our cross-domain solutions will have to support multiple of these data formats, not simply XML alone.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span class="">In the meantime, it is not hard to convert JSON to XML. It can even be done mechanically by a script. Alternately, a scenario similar to how Microsoft Office documents use their XML data could work, with a “container format” that consists of an XML metadata tag file bundled with the JSON (or Parquet, CSV, etc.) data and the whole bundle scanned and processed as a whole.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span>Also, if the requirement is simply to have an XML tagged file </span><em>about</em><span class=""> the data to transfer, that imposes no requirement for format on the transferred data at all. The data could be an image, Office document, audio file, movie, JSON or XML data and still be able to attach an XML-formatted metadata file if it were necessary.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-0" start="5">
  <li><span class="">Quality of Service and prioritization of data moving across the enterprise. The Commanding Officer of a ship should be able to “order up” the data they want in prioritized fashion. If it's properly tagged (again can use XML), they can exchange only what they want and need when they need it.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-1 start" start="1">
  <li class=" "><em>Response</em><span>: None of this is unique to XML. XML offers nothing here that JSON doesn’t already support. Cloud-based analytics systems that can filter or subset JSON data </span><em>already can do this today</em><span class="">, but this support is not available for XML-based data. Today’s ship COs can already prioritize tactical traffic and de-prioritize things like video data or non-critical web sites, even though these web sites aren’t using XML for the Web page content or video.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span class="">Given the context here, CO’s would be more likely to be “ordering up” individual types of data records that are tagged, not specific data elements within specific data records or data sets. In this environment the records could be any suitable data format (JSON, XML, images, video, PDFs, documents, etc.). This is more applicable to bulk storage like AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Note that AWS’s Simple Storage Service (S3) supports natively ‘ordering up’ bulk data, but only if the bulk data is JSON.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-0" start="6">
  <li><span class="">Another consideration is coalition interoperability, for NATO and others using XML.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class=" lst-kix_eitjk3zg2xky-1 start" start="1">
  <li class=" "><em>Response</em><span class="">: Use of XML to communicate to coalition partners does not require standardizing all data storage and data transfer throughout the entire Navy on XML. What would happen if one set of allies standardized on XML subset A (say, Microsoft Office Word documents) and another set of allies standardized on XML subset B (say, OpenDocument Text documents)? What happens if NATO adopts an XML standard and the United Nations adopts JSON in the same field?</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span class="">In fact a mandate to standardize on XML still wouldn’t prevent the Navy from having to adapt our data formats to meet an external XML interface. JSON is a benefit here, as its simplicity would allow the Navy to more easily convert it to other data types (often including XML-based data!) than if we had started from a complex XML data type.</span></li>
  <li class=" "><span>Moreover, the U.S. government itself mandates that Federal agencies publish a list in JSON format of their data sets. The General Services Administration and other Federal agencies have standardized on JSON data use already.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class=""> I would think that interoperability with the rest of the U.S. government would also be important to the U.S. Navy, not simply interoperability with NATO or other treaty organizations.</span></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="h.pp92b5lfxwan">Conclusion</h1>

<p class=""><span>In short, the mandatory use of XML and only XML for all applications of Navy data is infeasible, and attempting to do so will lead to potentially serious cybersecurity risks, prevent us from utilizing the capability of the commercial cloud, further increase the difficulty of recruiting and retaining Navy IT talent, and lock Navy into a dead XML compression ecosystem that hasn’t found traction since 2002.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class=""> We would also find that adopting XML wouldn’t have solved our data problems.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Instead, the Navy should avoid mandating specific data formats, especially since we cannot possibly understand the full extent and scope of our future data and data interface requirements or where the commercial ecosystem may continue to evolve. To fulfill the promise of C2C24 without “boiling the ocean” trying to convert all existing data at once, we should pursue an API-based strategy to serve as reference points for development while incrementally modernizing our data systems. We should also maintain flexibility on data formats to permit us to always be able to use the right tool for a given job.</span></p>

<p class=""><span class="">My analysis used this introduction as a base.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The “median” web size statistics were determined for each category of data type independently, ordering by the size in bytes of the data in the data type (e.g. the “median” web page for PNG images might be a different web page than the “median” web page for HTML data). Performing this analysis across the full dataset of 3.4 million page loads provided the data used in </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="#id.5tyrz0hyygv5">the EXI discussion</a></span><span>. The query used for the analysis is available at </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq%3D368182082215:5bba02098080494d944bdb372009b55e&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1559499944413000">https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=368182082215:5bba02098080494d944bdb372009b55e</a></span></p>
<p class=""><span>Filtering the data set to pages that loaded at least one byte of XML (or one byte of SVG, which is XML-based but tracked separately by Google) reveals that 870,760 pages (or 25%) resulted in at least one byte of XML being loaded, including SVG as XML. Or in other words, 75% of all web pages use no XML whatsoever. Of this 25% of pages using XML, the median Web page used 3,418 bytes of SVG image data and 0 bytes of ‘raw’ XML. The query used for this analysis is available at </span><span class="c11"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq%3D368182082215:3f4f2c6abe364fdd8cd4b5b6295d29d1&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1559499944414000">https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=368182082215:3f4f2c6abe364fdd8cd4b5b6295d29d1</a></span></p>
<p class=""><span>Filtering the data set of Web pages to pages that used XML for ‘business data’ of some sort (as opposed to imagery), by assuming that </span><em>any</em><span> usage of ‘raw’ XML is for business data gave the figure of 4.4% of Web sites using XML.
